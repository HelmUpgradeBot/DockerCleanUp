This is an automatable bot to clean up Docker images stored in an [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/) that are 90 days old or more.
It also checks that the ACR hasn't grown above a certain memory limit.

## :mag: Overview

This is an overview of the steps the bot executes.

- Logs into Azure using **either** a [Managed System Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) **or** interactive login (configurable with a command line flag)
- Logs in to the requested ACR via the Azure command line interface and Docker daemon
- Checks the size of the ACR and compares it to a requested size limit (configurable with a command line flag)
- Fetches the repositories and manifests for the images in the ACR and saves them in a pandas dataframe
- Filters out image digests that are older than the requested age limit (configurable with a command line flag) and deletes them
- Rechecks the size of the ACR
  - If the ACR is still larger than the requested size limit, the bot then executes a loop to delete the largest remaining image until the ACR is below the size limit

## ðŸ¤” Assumptions DockerCleanUpBot Makes

To login to Azure, the bot assumes it's being run from a resource (for example, a Virtual Machine) with a [Managed System Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) that has enough permissions ([Reader and AcrDelete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-roles) at least) to access the ACR and delete images.

## :pushpin: Installation and Requirements

To install this bot, you'll need to clone this repo and install the package.
It requires Python version >=3.7.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HelmUpgradeBot/DockerCleanUp.git
cd DockerCleanUp
python setup.py install
```

The bot will need access to the [Microsoft Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) and the [Docker CLI](https://docs-stage.docker.com/v17.12/install/) in order to query the ACR.

### :cloud: Installing Azure CLI (on Linux)

To install the Azure command line interface, run the following:

```bash
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

See the [Microsoft Azure CLI Installation docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) for more installation options.

### :whale: Installing Docker CLI (on Linux)

To install the Docker command line interface, run the following:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
```

You will need to restart the terminal for the second command to take effect.

## :children_crossing: Usage

Run the bot with the following command:

```bash
DockerCleanUpBot ACR_NAME \
    --max-age [-a] AGE \
    --limit [-l] SIZE_LIMIT \
    --ci CI_IMAGES \
    --identity \
    --dry-run \
    --purge
```

where:

- `ACR_NAME` (string) is the name of the ACR to be cleaned;
- `AGE` (integer, default = 90) is the maximum age in days for images in the ACR;
- `SIZE_LIMIT` (float, default = 2.0) is the maximum size in TB that the ACR is permitted to grow to;
- `CI_IMAGES` is a list of image names that have been built by Continuous Integration;
- `--identity` is a Boolean flag allowing the resource to login to Azure with a Managed System Identity; and
- `--dry-run` is a Boolean flag that prevents the images from actually being deleted;
- `--purge` is a Boolean flag that will delete all images in the Container Registry.

The script will generate a log file (`DockerCleanUpBot.log`) with the output of the actions.

## :clock2: CRON expression

To run this script at midnight on the first day of every month, use the following cron expression:

```bash
0 0 1 * * cd /path/to/DockerCleanUp && ~/path/to/python setup.py install &&DockerCleanUpBot.py [--flags]
```

## :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: Pre-commit Hook

For developing the bot, a pre-commit hook can be installed which will apply [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) linters and formatters to the Python files.
To install the hook, run the following:

```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```
